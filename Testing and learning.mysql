-- Hi, 
-- Suppose a school is holding elections, with a small modification: in this voting system, students are allowed to vote for as many candidates as they like, with the caveat that each time they vote their vote is split. For example, if a given student votes for 1 candidate, that candidate receives 1 whole vote, whereas if the student votes for 2 candidates then both will receive 1/2 of a vote.


--                     
-- Given the following table along with the rules above, write a SQL query to determine which candidate won the election.


--                     
-- Table name: election_data


--                     
-- Voter	Candidate
-- James	Susan
-- James	Jerry
-- John	Susan
-- Lucy	Alan
-- Terrance	Susan
-- Terrance	Alan
-- Howard	Jerry
